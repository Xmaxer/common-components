# --------------------
#
# Remember to
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   - Wrap the body at 72 characters
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
