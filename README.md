# Building

Common Components uses [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build final package.

To build follow the steps:

1. Run the 'build' script in the [package.json](./package.json)

Done! There will be a build folder created now, which contains the adjusted package.json
and all the required files (d.ts and .js)
