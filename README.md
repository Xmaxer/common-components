# Building

Common Components uses [Babel.js][babel] and [TypeScript][ts] to build final package.

To build the project, simply run the 'build' script found in the [package.json][packagejson]

Done! There will be a build folder created now, which contains the adjusted package.json
and all the required files (d.ts and .js)
